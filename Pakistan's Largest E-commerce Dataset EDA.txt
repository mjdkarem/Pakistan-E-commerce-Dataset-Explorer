- Prepare the dataset for further analysis or modeling.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about e-commerce transactions including:
- Order details (IDs, amounts, timestamps)
- Customer information
- Product categories
- Order status

## Structure
The notebook follows a structured flow:
1. **Data Upload & Loading**: Upload the dataset using Colab.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Standardize columns, handle missing values, convert types.
